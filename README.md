# InterviewPrep

As I prepare for interviews I'm going to be posting code that I write to practice here in this repository.

Most of this will be written in java, my first preference language, with a little bit written in C.

Most of this code was written on a whiteboard somewhere before I re-wrote it on my computer to do heavier testing. All of the code is written without an IDE, to make sure I can actually write the code without errors.
